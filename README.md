My own website, made for showing my certificates, my study projects & some useful information...

Technologies using for this Project are :
- for server side, Nodejs with the framework Expressjs & the module Nodemailer ;
- for client side, jQuery library with jQuery Easing plugin ;
- for custom JavaScript, CoffeeScript ;
- for HTML template, Pugjs ;
- for CSS, Stylus & Bootstrap with the template Freelancer from startbootstrap.com ;
- & for coding, Atom.

So all of the project technologies are from the JavaScript Universe.

For the moment, I have plan to include in the near future :
- for data binding (& more), Angular ;
- for database, mongoose & MongoDB ;
- for chat, Socket.io ;
- for admin interface, mongo-express.
